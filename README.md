# FmanOpenTerminal

## Overview
Fman Plugin to open iTerm / [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) at the current directory (instead of just opening cmd.exe).
When Windows Terminal is not installed, the regular command line opens.

This plugin overrides the default F9 binding.

In addion to the f9 key binding or the opening of the terminal using Fman's goto (ctrl+shift+p) command, it is also possible to open the terminal using the context menu.  
The native context menu as well as the file context menu have an "Open Terminal" added to them.

## Installation
[Ctrl+Shift+P -> Install Plugins -> FmanOpenTerminal](https://fman.io/docs/installing-plugins)

## Usage
- Click F9
- Open context menu and click at "New Terminal"
- Ctrl+Shift+p -> Open Terminal
